Any "vehicle" should be comprised of:

1. README with a description of the vehicle's configuration (i.e. ruddervator tail aft, etc)
2. Any relevant spreadsheets formatted in such a way that outputs can be easily exported
3. An OpenVSP file simply named "platform.vsp3"
4. Any other relevant things that we haven't thought of
